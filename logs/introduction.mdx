## Concept

All of the [Endpoint](/endpoints/introduction) executions called via laminar API are logged. For every run, the entire execution trace is logged, so the information you can see in logs includes, but is not limited to:

- Total execution time
- Total execution tokens and cost
- Outputs of every node in the pipeline
- Execution time of every node in the pipeline
- Execution cost of every node in the pipeline

## Accessing logs

1. Go to the logs page from the navbar
1. Select the endpoint that you want to examine
1. Click "Filter by pipeline versions" if you want to see logs of only certain versions
