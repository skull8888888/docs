## What is it

A Laminar project is a collection of [pipelines](/pipeline/introduction), [endpoints](/endpoints/introduction), [files](/files/introduction), [datasets](/datasets/introduction), [evaluations](/evaluations/introduction), and relevant [logs](/logs/introduction). Access [API keys](/api-reference/introduction#authentication) and environment variables are configured at the project level as well. Think about it as a scope of a certain work. A project always belong to a [workspace](/workspaces/introduction).
