### Regular event

Regular events are events for which the value is known at the code execution time. Similarly to semantic events, they belong to a span.

Regular events' timestamp will be recorded at the time, when they are called in the code.

Register an event in the Laminar UI and trigger it from the code using the `lmnr_context.event` function.

```python
from laminar import lmnr_context

# rest of the code

lmnr_context.event("Sentiment", "POSITIVE")
```
