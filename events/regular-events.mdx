description: Quickstart on how to setup regular events in Laminar

## Regular event

Regular events are events for which the value is known at the code execution time. Similarly to semantic events, they belong to a span.

Regular events' timestamp will be recorded at the time, when they are called in the code, unless another timestamp is provided.

Because of the OpenTelemetry compatibility, the `value` of the event can be Boolean, String, or Number, or a sequence of each.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to install the package and get your API key from the Laminar dashboard.
Read more in [Installation](/overview#installation).

### Sending regular events

<Warning>If an event is sent outside of span context, we will have nothing to associate it with, so it
won't be recorded. Make sure to wrap your function with `observe`.</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title = "Python">
    
```python
from lmnr import Laminar as L, observe

L.initialize()

@observe()
def my_function():
    # ...
    L.event("user_reaction", "left_conversation")
    # ...
```

</Tab>
<Tab title = "JavaScript/TypeScript">
    
```javascript
import { Laminar as L, observe } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

L.initialize()

await observe('myFunction', async () => {
    // ...
    L.event("user_reaction", "left_conversation")
    // ..
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Event metrics

All recorded events are available in the event metrics tab.
You can track the occurences of the event and the event outcome
