## Key concepts

Event value is known at the code execution time. Events belong to a span.
Events are timestamped when your code reports them, unless you explicitly specify a different time.

## Value types

The `value` of the event can be `Boolean`, `String`, or `Number`.

You don't have to explicitly specify the value type - the value type is inferred based on the first value sent with the event.

For example, if you send value named "is_calculator_tool_used" with value `true`, the event will be registered with the type `Boolean` in the current project.
Next time, if you send a non-boolean value to "is_calculator_tool_used", it will be ignored.

Note that the value type is project-specific. Events with the same name can have different types in different projects.

In Laminar's SDKs, `value` is optional. If a value is not provided, it will be inferred to be `Boolean` and set to `true`.
This is useful for events that are just a tag.

## Sending regular events

### Installation

<LaminarInstall />

### Project API key

<GetProjectApiKey />

### Example: Assertions

Let's consider an example where you want to assert that LLM response never contains the
name of a particular competitor. Each time the response does contain the competitor's name,
you want to record an event.

<Tab title = "Python">
    
```python
from lmnr import Laminar as L, observe

L.initialize(project_api_key='<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>')

competitor_name = "The Greatest Hospital in the Bay Area"

@observe()
def generate_response():
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "<User question>"}],
    )

    if competitor_name in response:
        L.event("contains_competitor_name", True)
        return "Sorry, I can't answer that."
    
    return response
```

</Tab>
<Tab title = "JavaScript/TypeScript">
    
```javascript
import { Laminar as L, observe } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

L.initialize({projectApiKey: '<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>'});

const competitorName = "The Greatest Hospital in the Bay Area";

await observe('myFunction', async () => {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4o",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: "<User question>" }],
    });

    if (response.includes(competitorName)) {
        L.event("contains_competitor_name", true);
        return "Sorry, I can't answer that.";
    }

    return response;
});
```

</Tab>

<Warning>If an event is sent outside of span context, we will have nothing to associate it with, so it
won't be recorded. Make sure to wrap the function where event is sent, or one of its parent functions, with `observe` or with a manual span context.</Warning>

Other use-cases for events may include:
- Record if the user's issue has been resolved by the assistant or not. Use `Boolean` value type.
- Track how many times and which tool has been used. Use `Boolean` value type for each tool call occurrence or `Number` value type for the total number of tool calls per conversation.
- Check if the assistant's response matches regular expressions. Use `Boolean` value type.

## Event metrics

All recorded events are available in the Laminar dashboard and in the events page.
In the events page, if you select an event, you can go to the specific trace where it was sent.
