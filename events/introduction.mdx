Events are building blocks of the analytics in Laminar. Events are powerful way to mine metrics from your trace data. There are two types of events:

- Regular events
- Semantic events

### Regular events

Regular events are programmatically triggered events. They are triggered by the user or the system save data which is passed directly to the event. They are useful for logging predefined metrics, errors, etc.

### Semantic events

Semantic events are generated by the LLM. They are triggered also triggered programmatically, however data passed to the event is then passed to the LLM and the LLM generates the appropriate event outcome based on the event description and instructions.An example of a semantic event would be a user sentiment detection.
