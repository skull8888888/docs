## General

Events are building blocks of the analytics in Laminar. Events are powerful way to mine metrics from your trace data. There are two types of events:

- Regular events
- Semantic events

### Regular events

Regular events are programmatically triggered events. They are triggered from the code manually. They are useful for logging predefined metrics, errors, etc.

Often, you would trigger events from code when there is not much overhead to do so.

### Semantic events

Semantic events are generated by the LLM.
They are also triggered programmatically, however data passed to the event is then passed to the LLM, and the LLM generates the appropriate event outcome based on the event description and instructions.
They will be processed on the background. To be more specific, they will be processed on the Laminar backend, which is outside of your main application code.
An example of a semantic event would be a user sentiment detection.
