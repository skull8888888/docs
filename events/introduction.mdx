## Why do we need events and events-based analytics?

LLM applications generate thousands of logs and traces every day.
Analyzing them manually and making sense of it is hard, if not impossible, considering the amount of data generated.

That's where events-based analytics comes in.

1. **Catch failures in real time**

Use Laminar's Semantic Events to catch failures in your agents in real-time based on the online evaluations.

2. **Evaluate and gather metrics on agent behavior**

Use Laminar's events to gather metrics on the user or agent behavior.

## Overview

Events are the building blocks of the analytics in Laminar.

Laminar Events are [OpenTelemetry-compatible](/events/otel).

All events belong to a span. In other words, every event must be sent within a function
[instrumented](/tracing/configuration) with Laminar.

### Event properties

Each event has the following properties:
1. **Name**

Name is needed to identify the event. Event name must be unique within the project.

For example, name can be `user_sentiment`.

2. **Value type**

There are three types of event values:
- `Boolean`
- `String`
- `Number`

3. **Value**

Based on the event value type, each event will have a value.

For example, an event of `Boolean` value type will be `true` or `false`.

4. **Timestamp**

Timestamp is the time when the event has been created.
If you don't specify the timestamp, the time at which the event was sent will be used.

### Sending events

You can send Laminar events and their values from code.

Events are useful when you want to make assertions, record known actions which agent takes,
or track metrics important for your use case.

For example, you can record if the response matches regular expressions,
if the chat assistant has found the answer to the user's question,
or which tool has been used how many times.
