## General

Events are building blocks of the analytics in Laminar. Events are powerful way to mine metrics from your trace data. There are two types of events:

- Regular events
- Semantic events

### Regular events

Regular events are programmatically triggered events. They are triggered from the code manually and the `value` is assigned by the user.

Often, you would trigger events from code when there is not much overhead to do so.

### Semantic events

The values for semantic events are assigned by LLM. They can be either Boolean, String, or Number [Learn more](/events/semantic-events)

Semantic events are also triggered programmatically. You pass `data` to the event and then event with that data is processed on our backend.
Event's data will be passed to the LLM, which generates the appropriate event outcome based on the event instructions.
To be more specific, they will be processed on the Laminar backend, so there is no overhead for your code.
An example of a semantic event would be a user sentiment detection.
