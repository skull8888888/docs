### Define a semantic event

Go to the events page and click on the "Create event" button.

<img src="/images/events/create-event.png" alt="Create event" width="400" />

Important fields to fill are:
- name
- description
- instructions
- event type

Name is a unique identifier of the event. It will be used to trigger the event.

Description is a short description of the event.

Instruction is provided to the LLM to generate the event outcome. Define the instructions in a way that the LLM will be able to generate the event outcome in a way that is easy to understand and track.

### Trigger a semantic event

To trigger a semantic event, call the `evaluate_event` function inside instrumented function.

```python
from laminar import observe, lmnr_context

# rest of the code

@observe()
def function_name()
    ...
    lmnr_context.evaluate_event("Sentiment", "<data to pass to the LLM>")
    ...

```

`evaluate_event` function will trigger the background process on Laminar side and the event outcome will be recorded in the event outcome tab.

### Event metrics

All recorded events are available in the event metrics tab. You can track the occurences of the event, the event outcome, and the event instructions.
