### Define a semantic event

Go to the events page and click on the "Create event" button.

<img src="/images/events/create-event.png" alt="Create event" width="400" />

Important fields to fill are:
- name
- description
- instructions
- event type

Name is a unique identifier of the event. It will be used to trigger the event.

Description is a short description of the event. It is used only for user's convenience and is not used to assign value to the event.

Instruction is provided to the LLM to generate the event outcome.
Define the instructions in a way that the LLM will be able to generate the event outcome in a way that is easy to understand and track.

### Trigger a semantic event

To trigger a semantic event, call the `evaluate_event` function inside instrumented function.

```python
from laminar import observe, lmnr_context

# rest of the code

@observe()
def function_name()
    ...
    lmnr_context.evaluate_event("Sentiment", "<data to pass to the LLM>")
    ...

```

`evaluate_event` function will trigger the background process on Laminar side and the event outcome will be recorded in the event outcome tab.

The semantic event's timestamp will be set as the end time of the span to which it belongs.

### Event metrics

All recorded events are available in the event metrics tab. You can track the occurences of the event, the event outcome, and the event instructions.
