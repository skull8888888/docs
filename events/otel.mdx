description: 'Details on Events and attributes in OpenTelemetry-compatible tracing with Laminar'
---

Laminar events are fully-compatible with OpenTelemetry events. They are stored in the `events` field of the span object.

This doc is fully for information purposes. As a user of Laminar, you don't have to deeply understand the internals of OpenTelemetry.

## Event object

| Attribute | Description | Type | Laminar representation (if different) | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | Name of the event | string | | `my_event` |
| time_unix_nano | Timestamp of the events in nanoseconds [1] | number | timestamp with Utc timezone | `1630000000000000000` |
| attributes | Attributes associated with the event. See below | Key-value pair. Value must be of `AttributeType` [2] | | `{"gen_ai.usage.output_tokens": 369}` |

[1] In most OpenTelemetry client implementations, you don't have to convert the timestamp to nanoseconds manually,
you can simply pass the `Date` / `datetime` object and the client will convert it to nanoseconds.

[2] `AttributeType` is a union of `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `Array<string>`, `Array<number>`, `Array<boolean>`

## Event attributes

| Attribute | Description | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lmnr.event.type` | Type of the event. Must be `default` or `evaluate` for default and semantic events respectively | string | `default` |

### Default event attributes

| Attribute | Description | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lmnr.event.value` | Value of the event. Can be Boolean, String, or Number, or a sequence of each. | `AttributeType` | `369` |

### Evaluate event attributes

| Attribute | Description | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lmnr.event.evaluator` | Name of the evaluator pipeline | string | `my_pipeline` |
| `lmnr.event.data` | Input to the evaluator pipeline | Key-value pair, stringified json | `{"input_node_name": "Is your AI agent working at all???!!!"}` |
| `lmnr.event.env` | Enviroment for the evaluator pipeline. This gets sent with every event, and is not recorded in Laminar, so that none of your API keys are stored. | Key-value pair, stringified JSON | `{"OPENAI_API_KEY": "my_openai_api_key"}` |
