import AutoInstrumentableJSModules from '/snippets/autoinstrumentable-js-modules.mdx';

## 1. Install Laminar

```bash
npm add @lmnr-ai/lmnr
```

## 2. Initialize Laminar

We suggest to disable Next.js OpenTelemetry instrumentation to avoid excessive tracing.

```bash
export NEXT_OTEL_FETCH_DISABLED=1
```

Then, choose the [app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) route you want to instrument
and initialize Laminar at the top of your route file.

```javascript
import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

Laminar.initialize({ projectApiKey: process.env.LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY });
```

Simple initialization may not work for all cases.

The best workaround is to selectively pass `instrumentModules` to `.initialize()`.
The example below shows how to do this for OpenAI and Anthropic.

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import * as anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

Laminar.initialize({
    projectApiKey: process.env.LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY,
    instrumentModules: { openAI: OpenAI, anthropic: anthropic }
});
```

If you want to try it quickly without manually importing and instrumenting all modules,
you can do simple initialization, however, you will need to import _and_ initialize Laminar **before importing LLM client libraries**.
This is because JavaScript binds the imported module to its name at import time, so introducing
instrumentation afterwards statically is not possible.

### Auto-instrumentable modules

Here's the list of modules that you can instrument:

<AutoInstrumentableJSModules />

## 3. Add Laminar initialization to every API route

Similarly to previous step, import and initialize Laminar at the top of every API route.
