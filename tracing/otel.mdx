This page is solely for information purposes.
As a user of Laminar, you don't have to deal with the internals of OpenTelemetry.

## Span object

| Attribute | Description | Type | Laminar representation (if different) | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| trace_id | Unique identifier for the trace | 16-bytes | UUID [1] | `01234567-89ab-4def-0123-456789abcdef` |
| span_id | Unique identifier for the span | 8-bytes | UUID [1] | `00000000-0000-0000-0123-456789abcdef` |
| parent_span_id | Unique identifier for the parent span | 8-bytes | UUID [1] | `00000000-0000-0000-0123-456789abcdef` |
| name | Name of the span | string | | `my_function` |
| events [2] | Events associated with the span | Array\<Event\> | | |
| attributes | Attributes associated with the span. Fully compatible with the `gen_ai` [semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md) | Key-value pair. Key must comply to semantic conventions, value must be of `AttributeType` [3] | | `{"gen_ai.usage.output_tokens": 369}` |
| start_time_unix_nano | Start time of the span in nanoseconds [4] | number | timestamp with UTC timezone | `1630000000000000000` |
| end_time_unix_nano | End time of the span in nanoseconds [4] | number | timestamp with UTC timezone | `1630000000000000000` |


[1] 13th digit in hex UUID depends on UUID version, so technically converting [OTel/WC3's](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#trace-id) 16-byte and, especially, 8-byte IDs
to UUIDs is not exactly UUID.

[2] Learn more about event attributes in the [Events Otel page](/events/otel)

[3] `AttributeType` is a union of `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `Array<string>`, `Array<number>`, `Array<boolean>`

[4] In most OpenTelemetry client implementations, you don't have to convert the timestamp to nanoseconds manually,
you can simply pass the `Date` / `datetime` object and the client will convert it to nanoseconds.

## Span attributes

Span attribute values that Laminar bases some of its functionality on:

| Attribute | Description | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gen_ai.system` | Model provider | string | `openai` |
| `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` | Number of tokens the LLM produced | number | 369 |
| `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` | Number of tokens in the LLM input | number | 42 |
| `gen_ai.usage.total_tokens` | Total number of tokens in the LLM input and output. If not specified, sum of `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` | number | 411 |
| `gen_ai.usage.cost` | Cost of the LLM call. If not specified, `system`, `input_tokens`, and `output_tokens` are used to estimate the cost Laminar-side in the background | number | 0.012 |
| `gen_ai.usage.request_model` | Model name specified in the request | string | `gpt-4o` |
| `gen_ai.usage.response_model` | Model name returned in the response | string | `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` |
| `gen_ai.prompt.{i}.content` | Content of the input message number i (starting from 0) | string | `write a poem about laminar flow` |
| `gen_ai.prompt.{i}.role` | Role of the input message number i (starting from 0) | string | `user` |

These _and_ all other attributes are stored as key-value pairs in the `attributes` field of the span.
