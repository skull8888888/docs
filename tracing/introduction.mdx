description: Tracing with Laminar

## Glossary

- Span – a unit of work representing a single operation in your application. A single "block" on the "waterfall" trace.
- Trace – collection of spans involved in processing a request in your LLM application.
Consists of one or more nested spans. A root span is the first span in a trace, and marks the beginning and end of the trace.
Trace holds spans and some additional metadata, such as total token count, session id or release version of your app.
- Event – a key-value pair of data with a timestamp represnting an event within your application. Must happen within a span.
- Session – a collection of traces that were serving the same user or the same interaction.

## Concept

Laminar offers comprehensive tracing and analytics of your entire application.
For every run, the entire execution trace is logged, so the information you can see in logs includes, but is not limited to:

- Total execution time
- Total execution tokens and cost
- Span-level execution time and token counts
- Inputs and outputs of each span

<Info>
    If your application calls a Laminar pipeline, each LLM node will be automatically traced.

## Accessing traces

1. Go to the traces page from the navbar on the left side of the page
1. Click on each row to see the detailed breakdown, and waterfalll of each log on the sidebar.
1. Click "Filter" and filter by the required criteria.

### Viewing more details

Simply click on any of the rows in the logs page and you will see the details in the side.

Click on each span to see its details, including inputs, outputs and metadata, as well as associated events.
