__Type `any` in this page refers to anything JSON/string serializable__

## Trace

Trace object has the following properties:

| Name       | Type     | Required | Example | Description |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| id         | uuid     | Yes      | `12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abc` | Unique ID of the trace. Auto-generated in SDK |
| version    | string   | Yes      | `"0.1.0"` | Current Laminar tracing protocol version. Auto-generated in SDK |
| success    | boolean  | No       | `true`    | Whether this trace was successful. Defaults to `true` |
| userId     | string   | No       | `usr-123` | Id of your user. Separate from metadata for easier analytics |
| sessionId  | string   | No       | `ses-123` | Id of your user session. Defaults to new stringified uuid, if not specified. Separate from metadata for easier analytics |
| release    | string   | No       | `v0.1`    | Release version of your app. Separate from metadata for easier analytics |
| metadata   | map\<string, any\> | No       | `{"k1": v1"}` | Any additional metadata you want to associate with your trace |

Trace object is in essence just a collection of spans (linked by `traceId` property on the spans) and some additional metadata.

A trace without spans will not be recorded.

Therefore, in instrumented code, unlike spans, traces are created immediately, and additional updates to them are sent with a
new trace object. If you use our SDK this is taken care of, but is something to be aware of, if you want to send the traces manually.

## Span

Span object has the following properties:


| Name       | Type     | Required | Example | Description |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| id         | uuid     | Yes      | `12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abc` | Unique ID of the span. Auto-generated in SDK |
| name       | string   | Yes      | `"foo"` | Name of the span. Defaults to the wrapped function name when created with decorators in SDK, or to LLM node name in the pipeline |
| traceId    | uuid     | Yes      | `12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abc` | Id of the trace that the span belongs to. Auto-populated in SDK |
| startTime  | datetime (UTC tz) | Yes | `2022-01-01T12:34:56Z` | Start time of the span in ISO 8601 format. Auto-populated in SDK |
| endTime    | datetime (UTC tz) | Yes | `2015-10-21T04:30:00Z | End time of the span in ISO 8601 format. Auto-populated in SDK |
| parentSpanId | uuid   | No       | `12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abc` | ID of the parent span. `null` for the top-level span. Auto-populated in SDK |
| input      | any      | No       | `"Hello, my name is Rex"` | Input to the span. Defaults to the wrapped function's arguments when created with decorators in SDK, or to LLM node inputs in the pipeline
| output     | any      | No       | `"Hi, Rex, nice to meet you"` | Output of the span. Defaults to the wrapped function's return value when created with decorators in SDK, or to LLM nodes output in the pipeline
| attributes | map \<string, any\> | No | `{'gen_ai.usage.input_tokens}` | Any otel-style attributes. For LLM spans, attributes comply to [otel standards](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md) |
| metadata   | map \<string, any\> | No | `{"k1": v1"}` | Any additional metadata you want to associate with your span |
| events     | Event[] | No | - | Events associated with this span. See [events](/events/introduction) for more
| evaluateEvents | EvaluateEvent[] | No | - | Events associated with this span that Laminar must assess. See [events](/events/introduction) for more

In instrumented code, unlike traces, spans wait in the context until the entire tracked function finishes, collecting any events or metadata.
A span can be sent only once and as a complete object. If you use our SDK this is taken care of, but is something to be aware of,
if you want to send the spans manually.

## Event

An occurence of an event in your application. Read more in [events](/events/introduction).

| Name       | Type     | Required | Example | Description |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| id         | uuid     | Yes      | `12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abc` | Unique ID of the event. Auto-generated in SDK |
| templateName | string | Yes      | `"correctness"` | Name of the event template. Must match the name defined in Laminar UI in advance |
| timestamp  | datetime (UTC tz) | Yes | `2022-01-01T12:34:56Z` | Timestamp of the event in ISO 8601 format. Auto-populated in SDK |
| spanId     | uuid   | No       | `12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abc` | ID of the span the event belongs to. Auto-populated in SDK |
| value      | string \| number \| boolean | No | `42` | Value associated with the event |

## EvaluateEvent

An occurence of an event that Laminar must evaluate and store. Read more in [events](/events/introduction)

| Name       | Type     | Required | Example | Description |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| templateName* | string   | Yes      | `"correctness"` | Name of the event template. Must match the name defined in Laminar UI in advance |
| data       | string | Yes | "I am an LLM and I am hallucinating" | Data to evaluate the event against |
| timestamp  | datetime (UTC tz) | Yes | `2022-01-01T12:34:56Z` | Timestamp of the event in ISO 8601 format. Auto-populated in SDK |

\* in `lmnr` python package `templateName` is called `name` in `v0.3` up to `0.3.3`.
