This will automatically instrument all major LLM providers, LLM frameworks including LangChain and LlamaIndex, and even vector
DB calls. Execute your code to see traces in the Laminar dashboard.

To disable or configure automatic instrumentation,
see the section on [Automatic instrumentation](/tracing/automatic-instrumentation).
