## Glossary

**Pipeline** – an instance of a complete workflow.

**Commit** – a saved snapshot of a pipeline, similar to a git commit. Commit versions can be deployed to [endpoints](/endpoints/introduction)

**Workshop version** - a draft version. Every pipeline has exactly one workshop version. Think of it as a git HEAD.

**Node** – a core component of a pipeline that performs data transformation and passes the result downstream.

**Handle** – an input or output point of a node. Input handles of one node can be connected to output handles of another one.

**Env variable** - an environment variable for the project's scope, which is used for the nodes, which require it.

## Getting started

When you create new project you will first be redirected to the projects pipeline page.

Alternatively, find it in the navigation column on the left.

First, create a pipeline, by clicking "New pipeline" button in the pipelines page. Give it a custom name. You will be redirected to the page of the newly created pipeline.
