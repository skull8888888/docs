title: 'Working with nodes'

## Overview

There can be various types of nodes.
We first suggest to read the general instructions on how to work with nodes here, and then jump
to the specific instructions on working with each particular node
such as [LLM node](/nodes/LLM),
[Semantic Search node](/nodes/semantic-search),
[Semantic Router node](/nodes/semantic-router), etc.

## Naming nodes

Every node has a name. This:
- Is required, when calling deployments, to direct inputs to the correct input nodes and correctly parse the response
- Is required for proper integration with datasets and evaluations
- Is a utility for you when analyzing logs and traces.

All nodes names within a pipeline **must be unique**. Pipeline execution itself can run fine with repeated node names, but other functionality may be impaired.

## Connecting nodes – Handles

To connect nodes, use Handles, which are small holes on the left or right side of each node.
Connect the nodes by dragging a connection from one node's output handle to another node's input handle.

Input handles appear on the left side of a node; output handles are on the right side of a node.
Depending on the node type, there can be 0 or more input handles and 0 or more output handles.

Each input handle must take exactly 1 connection, however an output handle can be connected to many other nodes.

In other words, one node's output can serve as an input to multiple nodes, but not the other way around.

### Handle types

Depending on the data the node expects, there are different types of handles.

- **String** – basic text input
- **ChatMessageList** – JSON array of `ChatMessage` objects in chronological order of the chat conversation. `ChatMessage` has 2 required fields: `role` and `content`. `role` is a string, normally `"user"`, `"assistant"`, or `"system"`, but may vary depending on the LLM provider. `content` is string content of a message.

Only handles of the same type can be connected to each other.

### Conditional output handles

For some nodes, including [Semantic Router node](/nodes/semantic-router), the result of the node execution (and hence the entire pipeline flow) will be directed to just one of the outputs. The selection depends on the node configuration and on the input data it receives.

## Dynamic inputs

For relevant nodes, e.g. [LLM node](/nodes/LLM) and [Unify node](/nodes/unify),
we allow the system message to be templated with the user input for each call.
This is achieved with enclosing your `{{variables}}` in double curly braces, a.k.a mustache syntax.
To start, simply enclose a word in your node's "prompt" field in doubly curly braces. After that, a new input handle of type `String`, named with that enclosed word,
will appear on the left hand side of the node.
