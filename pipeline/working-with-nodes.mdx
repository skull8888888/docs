## Naming nodes

Every node has a name. This:
- Is required, when calling deployments, to direct inputs to the correct input nodes and correctly parse the response
- Is required for proper integration with datasets and evaluations
- Is a utility for you when analyzing logs and traces.

All nodes names within a pipeline **must be unique**. Pipeline execution itself can run fine with repeated node names, but other functionality may be impaired.

## Connecting nodes

Input handles appear on the left side of a node; output handles are on the right side of a node. Depending on the node type, there can be 0 or more input handles and 0 or more output handles. Connect the nodes by dragging a connection from one node's output handle to another node's input handle.

Each input handle must take exactly 1 connection, however an output handle can be connected to many other nodes. In other words, one node's output can serve as an input to multiple nodes, but not the other way around.

### Handle types

Depending on the data the node expects, there are different types of handles.

- String – basic text input
- StringList – JSON array of strings, e.g. `["Hello", "World"]`
- ChatMessageList – JSON array of `ChatMessage` objects in chronological order of the chat conversation. `ChatMessage` has 2 required fields: `role` and `content`. `role` is a string, normally `"user"`, `"assistant"`, or `"system"`, but may vary depending on the LLM provider. `content` is string content of a message.
- \[DEPRECATED\] ~~ThreadChatMessage – a JSON object, same as `ChatMessage` but with an optional field `threadId`.~~ This was used in the agent node, currently being replaced by agentic behaviour of the builder flow itself.

Only handles of the same type can be connected to each other.

## Input and Output nodes

Input and Output nodes are special. They "define" the API once you deploy the pipeline. That is, your request to a [Laminar endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/endpoint_run) API must send all inputs in a map following the pattern `"inputNodeName": "inputValue"`. Similarly, the response message contains a map from each output node's name to the output result of that node. Read more in [api reference](/api-reference/endpoint/endpoint_run).

In addition, whenever you drag and drop a new input node, an input field will appear in the sidebar on the left. You must fill this field in order to run the pipeline.

For your convenience, upon new connection, input node changes its name to match the handle it is being connected to.

### Input types

An input node has a type, which defines the type of output it produces and the type for its output handle as well.
For example, `StringList` input node produces a `StringList` output and can be connected only to input handles expecting `StringList` value, e.g. Semantic Search's `query` handle.

For your convenience, upon new connection, an unconnected input node changes its type and name to follow the type and name of a handle it is being connected to.
