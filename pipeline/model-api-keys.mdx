## Reason

If you use API providers that require special authentication, such as openai, or mistral, you will need to specify your own API keys to laminar, so that laminar can make calls to these APIs.

## Setting up

Go to the API keys page, fill in all the required keys, and click "Save"

## Safety

Laminar never stores your model provider API keys. For your local experiments, the keys are stored in your browser's storage.
