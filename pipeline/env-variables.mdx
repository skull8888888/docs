## Reason

If you use LLM node, Postgres node, or third-party integration nodes that require special authentication, you will need to specify your own API keys to laminar, so that laminar can make calls to these APIs.
For example, if you use LLM node with "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k" model, then you'll need to specify `OPENAI_API_KEY` in "env variables" page.

## Setting up

First, navigate to "env variables" page, using the navigation on the left of the screen.

<Frame caption="env variables page">
<img height="200" src="/images/pipeline-builder/env-variables.png" />
</Frame>

To add a key do the following:
1. Press "Add variable"
2. Select a [pre-defined variable](/pipeline/env-variables#pre-defined-env-variables) name or add a custom one.
3. Enter the value.
4. Press "Add" in the dialog.

Note that some nodes such as, for example, LLM node have pre-defined env variables.
For other nodes, if there's an option in a pipeline builder's particular node to set a name for env variable, you can set it on the node and add a custom variable with such name.

</Frame>

## Pre-defined env variables

- LLM node: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
- Unify node: `UNIFY_API_KEY`
- Zenguard node: `ZENGUARD_API_KEY`
- PostgresRead node: `POSTGRES_URL`

## Safety

Laminar never stores your env variables.
The keys are stored in your browser's storage and are used for pipeline runs in the "pipelines" page and evaluation jobs, triggered manually by the user.

When you call an Endpoint, the variables set in this page are not used. For each endpoint call, you'll need to pass `env` in the payload.
