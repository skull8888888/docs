## Dynamic inputs

For relevant nodes, i.e. Chat and Instruct, we also allow the message to be changed with the user input between different calls. This is achieved with enclosing your `{{variables}}` in double curly braces, a.k.a moustache syntax. To start, simply enclose a word in your node's prompt/system message field, and a new handle of type `String`, and named with that enclosed word will appear on the left hand side of the node.

## String Template node

Sometimes, you may want to replace another input value or make longer or nested templates. For that purpose, you can use String Template node and nest strings however you wish!
