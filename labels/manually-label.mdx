To manually label spans, open the trace and click on the span you want to label.
Then, click on the "Add label" button in the top right corner. Here you can choose
one of the existing label classes or create a new one, and then assign a value to
the span.

### Creating a new label class

To create a new label class, click on the "New label" button.

When you create a new label class, you can choose between `Boolean` and `Categorical` label types.

For boolean labels, the possible values are `true` and `false`. For categorical labels, you can
define the possible values.
