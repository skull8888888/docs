title: Checks
Description: verifications executed on the pipeline version upon deployment to the endpoint
---

## Creating checks

You can create checks from the endpoint page. Available check types:

- Evaluation - run [evaluation](/evaluations/introduction) of a pipeline

Currently, there is a hard limit of 10 checks per endpoint that you can add.

### Evaluation check settings

You can choose an existing evaluation or create one. Then select the target score. The check will pass if and only if the evaluation result is a score higher than or equal to the target score

## Running checks

For now, the checks can only be run automatically at the time of deployment. The status of the checks is updated real-time as the checks run. Possible check statuses:

- Running
- Passed
- Not passed
- Execution error

Currently, "Not passed" and "Execution error" produce the same result and look the same; however, the difference is that "Not passed" means that the check did not meet the check requirements, such as target score, wheeas "Execution error" means that there was an error running the check, most likely this is to do with the graph correctness or required model api keys not specified in the project
