## Concept

Endpoints live inside projects and have externally accessible names. You can call endpoints from your applications via [laminar api](/api-reference/introduction). Every endpoint has exactly one target pipeline version. This is the flow that will be executed every time the endpoint is called from the API.

## Deployment flow

1. User clicks deploy from the pipeline editing page and selects the endpoint.
1. The state of the pipeline is saved in a __new__ version.
1. That version becomes the candidate version for this endpoint.
1. Checks execution kicks off.
1. If checks are passed correctly, the existing target pipeline version is 'retired', and the candidate version is 'promoted' to the target of the endpoint.
