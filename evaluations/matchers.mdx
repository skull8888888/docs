## Matcher metadata

A matcher may have optional metadata field associated to the matcher. This is intended to store information that is common across all datapoints, i.e. global to the entire matcher. For example, for regex matcher, the regular expression pattern is stored in its metadata.

## Matcher types

Available matcher types are:
- Exact
- Regex
- Semantic similarity

## Exact matcher

This is the simplest matcher that compares two strings for exact equality. It does not do trim/strip any surrounding whitespaces. It is also case-sensitive.

### Scoring:

If two strings are identical, score of `1.0`. Otherwise, score of `0.0`.

### Examples

|Target data       | Actual data  | score
|------------------|--------------|------
|`"Hello!"`        | `"Hello!"`   | `1.0`
|`"Hello, world!"` | `"Hello!"`   | `0.0`
|`"Hello!"`        | `"hello!"`   | `0.0`
|`"Hello!"`        | `"Hello!\n"` | `0.0`

## Regex matcher

Matches all points except the matcher's regular expression pattern.

### Scoring

If there is a match of the matcher's regex in the given text, score of `1.0`. Otherwise, score of `0.0`.

### Examples

|Target data       | Actual data    | score
|------------------|----------------|------
|`"Hello!"`        | `"\w+!"`       | `1.0`
|`"Hello, world!"` | `"Hel+o \w+!"` | `1.0`
|`"Hello!"`        | `"\d+"   `     | `0.0`


## Semantic similarity matcher

Compares two strings based on their semantic similarity in the embedding space.

### Scoring

Cosine similarity between two embedding vectors for the input in the range of `0.0` - `1.0`

### Examples

These are two gpt-3.5-turbo-16k generated hokkus about cheese, and one example of dissimilar strings

|Target data       | Actual data    | score
|------------------|----------------|------
|`"In creamy embrace,\nMelted dreams upon my tongue,\nCheese, my mouth's delight"`| `"Milky moon unfolds,\nCascading curds, divine treat,\nCheese dreams weave their spell"` | `0.803100049495697`
|`"Soft as clouds, it rests,\nGouda melts on eager tongue,\nCheese dreams come alive."` | `"Melted on bread's crust,\nSavoring bliss, taste transcends,\nCheese's golden touch."` | `0.7639690637588501`
|`"Roses are red"`        | `"Are you gonna buy a flight ticket?"`     | `0.4335864782333374`
