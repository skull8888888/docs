## Concepts

Evaluation is a concept of evaluating all datapoints in a dataset.

- Evaluator pipeline – the pipeline that is run with every datapoint and must produce a numeric result.
- Executor pipeline – optionally, before running the evaluator pipeline, you can run another pipeline on the dataset.
This pipeline is called "executor pipeline". Its output will be passed to the evaluator pipeline.
- `target` – data sent to the evaluator pipeline.
- `data` – data sent to the executor pipeline.

Evaluation does the following for every datapoint in the dataset:

1. Check if executor pipeline is selected. If so.
    1. Set all the points in `data` of the datapoint as values to the input nodes of the _executor_ pipeline.
        For example, if the executor pipeline has inputs `"color"`  and `"season"`,
        then evaluation run would look for keys `"color"` and `"season"` in `data`
        and substitute the respective pipeline inputs with the values corresponding
        to these keys in the datapoints when running the executor pipeline.
    1. The pipeline is run. All required [env variables](/pipeline/env-variables) must be set for this to succeed.
    1. All outputs of the _executor_ pipeline are extracted and set as inputs to the _evaluator_ pipeline.
1. Set all the points in `target` of the datapoint as values to the input nodes of the _evaluator_ pipeline.
1. Evaluator pipeline is run. All required [env variables](/pipeline/env-variables) must be set for this to succeed.
1. Evaluator pipeline produces a single numeric input. This is stored in the results of the evaluation.

<Tip>
  Results of the executor pipeline are sent as inputs to the evaluator pipeline.
  Make sure to name the outputs of the executor pipelne same as the correspoding inputs of the evaluator pipeline.
</Tip>

## Creating and running an evaluation

1. Go to "evaluations" page in the navbar.
1. Click "New evaluation" at the top of the page.
1. Give the evaluation a name.
1. Select the evaluator pipeline and commit.
1. [OPTIONAL] Select the executor pipeline and commit.
1. Select the dataset.

Note, that evaluation will run only against the datapoints that have all required input keys to fill in
the evaluator pipeline's input nodes (`target`) and the executor pipeline's input nodes (`data`).

### Status and results of the evaluation

Possible statuses of evaluations:
- Started
- Finished

Individual datapoint statuses "Success" / "Failed" are stored at datapoint level.
