description: Evaluate the correctness of pipeline results

## Introduction

You can evaluate the correctness of various flows using custom Laminar pipelines.
The only requirements are a [dataset](/datasets/introduction)
to run the evaluations against and a pipeline that produces a numeric output.

There are two possible setups for evaluations:
1. Running Laminar pipeline and evaluating its results with another pipeline [Learn more](/evaluations/evaluation-with-executor)
1. Running an evaluator pipeline on a dataset. [Learn more](/evaluations/evaluation-data-only)

## Status and results of the evaluation

Possible statuses of evaluations:
- Started
- Finished

Individual datapoint statuses "Success" / "Failed" are stored at datapoint level.
