description: 'Evaluate results of previous runs stored in a dataset'

## Key concepts

- Evaluator pipeline - the pipeline evaluating the results
- Dataset format â€“ two fixed JSON objects: `target` and `data`, each with any keys.

## Flow overview

<Tip> **What happens if `data` and `target` have overlapping keys?**
Values in `target` have higher priority over and overwrite the values in `data`. </Tip>

## Detailed flow

For every datapoint in the dataset, evaluation does the following:

1. Merge the `data` and `target` objects. If keys clash, values in `target` are selected.
1. Set all the values in the resulting merged object as values to the input nodes of the evaluator pipeline.
This is done by matching* the keys of the object to the input node names of the evaluator pipeline.
1. Evaluator pipeline is run. All required [env variables](/pipeline/env-variables) must be set for this to succeed.
1. Evaluator pipeline produces a single numeric output. This is stored in the results of the evaluation.

## Requirements

- Evaluator pipeline has at least one commit.
- Object obtained by merging `target` and `data` at least contains keys matching* the names of the input nodes
on the evaluator pipeline.
- All required environment variables for the evaluator run are set in the [Env vars page](/pipeline/env-variables#full-set-up).
- Evaluator pipeline must produce one output. This output must be parsable into a number (8-bit float).
