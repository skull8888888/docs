This is first tutorial (1/2) in a series about how to develop and deploy your pipeline on Laminar.
It aims to showcase how you can fully develop and orchestrate an LLM pipeline or agent on Laminar, and then fully host it on Laminar just by running a few commands.

## Intro

In this tutorial, we will build a pipeline that calls your own code.

The demo application will:
1. Take a user's question and a website URL as an input.
1. Read and parse a website using Beautiful Soup.
1. Call an LLM with the input quetion and the content of the website
1. Return the result to the user

## Prerequisites

- Python - Install Python3.9+
- poetry - Install poetry for managing your dependencies in a project [(Read more)](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- Understanding of how to create a pipeline from template on Laminar [(Read more)](/tutorials/first-pipeline#creating-a-pipeline)

## Building the flow

First, create a pipeline starting from "Blank" template.
Place a function node and define the signature of your function.

The function takes in the url and returns the contents of the website.

Then, place an LLM node and prompt it with the following prompt:

```
You are a question answering machine that responds user's questions about the contents of a website. You must ground your response in the content of the website and try not to add your own knowledge. If the provided content does not have the response, acknowledge it.

User's question:
{{question}}

Website content:
{{parsed_content}}
```

The mustache variables will create input handles on the left of the node.

Finally place additional input node, and rename the input nodes to `question` and `url`. 

Connect the `url` input to the `parse_website` node, `question` to the `question` handle on LLM,
output of `parse_website` node to the `parsed_content` handle on the LLM, and the LLM node to the output node.

The final flow will look like this

## Implementing Function node

Now, we need to actually add code for the Function node called `parse_website`.

You'll need to use IDE of your choice and terminal.

Run the following commands in terminal:
```
mkdir website_qa
cd website_qa
poetry init --no-interaction
poetry add lmnr requests bs4
poetry shell
```

We've created a project and installed `lmnr` library there. Also we installed `requests` and `bs4` libraries to make requests and parse them.
Also, we activated our poetry environment to call CLI commands with `lmnr` later.

Now create `pipeline.py` file in your IDE next to generated `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files.
Also, create `src` folder with `__init__.py` and `request.py` files.

Your directory structure should look like this:
```
website_qa/
│
├── pipeline.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── poetry.lock
│
└── src/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── request.py
```

Let's define a function which makes the request and parses it in `src/request.py`.

```python
# src/request.py
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup


def parse_website(url: str) -> str:
    html_content = requests.get(url).text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
    text_content = soup.get_text()

    return text_content
```

You can write and store code of any complexity in `src/`. Just make sure it's properly structured according to Python's module import rules.
Place `__init__.py` files in all subdirectories.

Now, let's go to `pipeline.py` and register the function for the `parse_website` node.

pipeline.py must have variable `lmnr` of type `Pipeline` where you register the functions to be used for your nodes.

```python
# pipeline.py
from lmnr import Pipeline

from src.request import parse_website


lmnr = Pipeline()


@lmnr.func("parse_website")
def parse_url(url: str) -> str:
    return parse_website(url)
```

At this point, we need to connect the local code to our pipeline. Let's go back to your terminal.

You'll need to set your project id as an environment variable, so that we can locate the project in which you built your pipeline.
[Read here](https://docs.lmnr.ai/api-reference/introduction#authentication) on how to get project API key.

`export LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY={your project api key}`

Then run `lmnr dev` to establish connection with your server.

You should see the following output:

```
========================================
Debugger Session ID:
{DEBUGGER_SESSION_ID}
========================================

Registered functions:
- parse_website

========================================
```

Copy `DEBUGGER_SESSION_ID` and paste it in the `Env` in the header of the pipeline builder.

Note that if you restart `lmnr dev`, then you'll need to paste new `DEBUGGER_SESSION_ID`.

Now we're ready to test the flow.

## Testing the flow

Let's test the end-to-end flow with a couple simple inputs

Fill in the url input on the left with `https://docs.lmnr.ai/tutorials/getting-started`

Ask a question about this page in the question input on the left, e.g. "What is a Laminar workspace".

Then press Cmd + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) or click run button.

You can try to play around with your agent and, when you're ready to deploy it, move on to the [next tutorial](/tutorials/deploy-on-laminar).
