## Intro

In this tutorial, we will build a pipeline that calls your own code.

The demo application will:
1. Take a user's question and a website URL as an input.
1. Read and parse a website using Beautiful Soup.
1. Call an LLM with the input quetion and the content of the website
1. Return the result to the user

## Prerequisites

- Python - Install Python3.9+
- poetry - Install poetry for managing your dependencies in a project

## Building the flow

First, create a pipeline starting from blank template.
Place a function node and define the signature of your function.

The function takes in the url and returns the contents of the website.

Then, place an LLM node and prompt it with the following prompt:

```
You are a question answering machine that responds user's questions about the contents of a website. You must ground your response in the content of the website and try not to add your own knowledge. If the provided content does not have the response, acknowledge it.

User's question:
{{question}}

Website content:
{{parsed_content}}
```

The {{mustache}} variables will create input handles on the left of the node.

Finally place additional input node, and rename the input nodes to `question` and `url`. 

Connect the `url` input to the `parse_website` node, `question` to the `question` handle on LLM,
output of `parse_website` node to the `parsed_content` handle on the LLM, and the LLM node to the output node.

The final flow will look like this

## Testing the flow

Let's test the end-to-end flow with a couple simple inputs

Fill in the url input on the left with `https://docs.lmnr.ai/tutorials/getting-started`

Ask a question about this page in the question input on the left, e.g. "What is a Laminar workspace".
