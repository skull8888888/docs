description: Migrate your existing flow to Laminar and deploy it as a Laminar endpoint
---

This tutorial will teach you how to move an existing LLM application flow to Laminar, then expose it as an API,
and update your application logic to call Laminar instead.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will make a relatively simple flow, but you can always improve it later.
