## Migration to the new endpoint

This guide will help you update your existing endpoint calls to the new pipeline calls.

### 1. Preparing code (Skip if you don't use function nodes)

Now that pipeline's do not host custom code any more, you will have to integrate any of the code you have had 
in Function nodes closer into your codebase. Essentially, it will be your responsibility to orchestrate the code
and call the functions when you need to, not pipeline's.

This step is highly specific to each application.

### 2. Splitting pipelines (Skip if you don't use function nodes)

On the high level, you will have to split your pipelines into separate pipelines at each Function node.

Below is a simple example:

![](/images/tutorials/with-function-node-before.png)

This pipeline is a simple agent that either summarizes texts or writes reviews.
It starts with a `decision_maker` LLM that decides which of the two options matches user intention.
It is then followed by a function `process_decision`, that does some custom post processing on the decision,
e.g. parsing JSON structured output of the model.
Next, the switch directs the flow to one of the more custom prompted LLMs for the final task to be performed.

This pipeline will have to be broken down at the function node. Everything before it will go to one pipeline,
and everything after it goes to another.

The results must look something like the following:

![](/images/tutorials/without-function-node-after-1.png)

![](/images/tutorials/without-function-node-after-2.png)

The first pipeline calls the first LLM for a decision, and the post-processing happens in your code.

The second one calls one of the LLMs, and can be amended to call some more LLMs in parallel, e.g. in a Mixture of Agents style approach.

### 3. Calling pipelines directly

The first step to call a pipeline directly is to set a target commit right in the pipeline page. This is done in a few simple steps.

1. Commit a working version. This is optional in case you have done this previously and have existing commit versions.
1. Go to the commited version.
1. Click "Set as target"

Next, update your code to call pipeline instead of endpoints.

If you've been calling the endpoints from Python or TS SDKs, the change is relatively small.

#### Python

```sh
poetry add lmnr@0.3.0b1
poetry lock && poetry install # optionally
```

```python
from lmnr import Laminar

l = Laminar('<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>')
result = l.run(
    pipeline = 'my_pipeline_name',  # instead of `endpoint = 'my_endpoint_name'`
    inputs = {'input_node_name': 'some_value'},
    # all environment variables
    env = {'OPENAI_API_KEY': 'sk-some-key'},
    # any metadata to attach to this run's trace
    metadata = {'session_id': 'your_custom_session_id'}
)

```

If you've used types `EndpointRunRequest`, `EndpointRunResponse`, and `EndpointRunError`, they will now be changed to
`PipelineRunRequest`, `PipelineRunResponse`, and `PipelineRunError` respectively.

#### Typescript

```sh
pnpm i @lmnr-ai/lmnr@0.3.0
```

```javascript
import { Laminar, NodeInput } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

const l = new Laminar('<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>');
const result = await l.run({
    pipeline: 'my_pipeline_name',  // instead of `endpoint: 'my_endpoint_name',`
    inputs: {'input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'hello'}]},
    env: {'OPENAI_API_KEY': 'sk-some-key'}, // optional
    metadata: {'session_id': 'your_custom_session_id'}, // optional
}); 
```

If you've used types `EndpointRunRequest` and `EndpointRunResponse` they will now be changed to
`PipelineRunRequest` and `PipelineRunResponse` respectively.

#### Direct API requests

You will need to change:
- URL from `https://api.lmnr.ai/v2/endpoint/run` to `https://api.lmnr.ai/v1/pipeline/run`
- `"endpoint"` key in the body of the request to `"pipeline"`
- the corresponding value to the name of your pipeline rather than the name of your endpoint.

Before:

```sh
curl 'https://api.lmnr.ai/v2/endpoint/run' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "endpoint": "my_endpoint_name",
  "inputs": {
    "my_input_node_name": "input_value"
  },
  "env": {},
  "metadata": {}
}'
```

After

```sh
curl 'https://api.lmnr.ai/v1/pipeline/run' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "pipeline": "my_pipeline_name",
  "inputs": {
    "my_input_node_name": "input_value"
  },
  "env": {},
  "metadata": {}
}'
```
