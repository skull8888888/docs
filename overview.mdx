Laminar is an open-source observability and analytics platform for complex LLM apps. 
Laminar helps developers build better LLM applications by providing a comprehensive
set of tools for observability, analytics, and prompt chain management.

Living at the intersection of tracing and event-based analytics, Laminar is
like Datadog + PostHog for LLM applications.

Check our [Github repo](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr) to learn more about how it works or if you are interested in self-hosting.

### Code change

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

Annotate your code with `@observe()` decorator to start tracing and turn on the OpenAI auto-instrumentation.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from lmnr import Laminar as L, Instruments, observe

L.initialize(
    project_api_key=os.environ["LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY"],
    instruments={Instruments.OPENAI},
)

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

def poem_writer(topic: str):
    prompt = f"write a poem about {topic}"
    # OpenAI calls are automatically instrumented
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
        ],
    )
    poem = response.choices[0].message.content
    return poem

@observe() # annotate all functions you want to trace
def handle_user_request(...):
    ...

    poem = poem_writer(topic="laminar flow")
    
    ...

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="JavaScript/TypeScript">

Wrap your function with `observe` to start tracing.

```javascript
import { observe, Laminar as L } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
// ...

// Initialize Laminar
L.initialize({ projectApiKey: "<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>" });

// ...

// Wrap all functions you want to trace
await observe('myFunction', async () => {
    /// ...

    // LLM calls are automatically traced with OpenLLMetry
    openai.chat.completions.create(
        // ...
    )
    // events can be sent with L.event. Event values are OpenTelemetry compliant,
    // so they have to be strings, numbers, booleans, or arrays of those.
    L.event("event_name", "event_value")
});

```

Learn more about instrumenting your code by checking our [Python SDK](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr-python) and [JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr-ts).

### Project API key

To get the project API key, go to the Laminar dashboard, click the project settings,
and generate a project API key.
Unless specified at initialization, Laminar will look for the key in the `LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY` environment variable


## Features

### Observability

With Laminar, you can instrument your entire LLM application and track the full execution trace.
Adding instrumentation is as simple as adding a Python decorator to your function (wrapping into another function in the case of Javascript/Typescript).

It is compatible with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/) tracing through the means of [OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry).

Get started with [Tracing](/tracing/introduction).

### Analytics

Laminar provides infrastructure to run LLM analysis to extract semantic events,
such as "user sentiment" or "did my LLM agent upsell?", and then turn them
into trackable metrics. Combining these events with the trace data allows
you to link back to the specific user interaction that caused the event
and gives you a better understanding of the user experience.

In addition, you can track raw metrics, by sending events with values directly
to Laminar.

Learn more about [Events](/events/introduction) extraction.

### Prompt chain management

You can build and host chains of prompts and LLMs and then call them as if each chain was a single function.
It is especially useful when you want to experiment with techniques, such as Mixture of Agents
and self-reflecting agents, without or before hosting prompts and model configs in your code.

Learn more about [Pipeline builder](/pipeline/introduction) for prompt chains.

### Evaluations

In addition to semantic events, Laminar allows you to run evaluations and analyze their
results in the dashboard.

You can use Laminar's JavaScript and Python SDKs to set up and ran your evaluations.

Learn more about [Evaluations](/evaluations/introduction).
