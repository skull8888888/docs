## Concepts and getting around

### Projects and workspaces

Once you sign up on Laminar, you will get to your [dashboard](https://www.lmnr.ai/projects).
Here you can see and manage your workspaces and projects.
When you create an account, you are created your personal workspace by default.

A Laminar project is a collection of [pipelines](/documentation/pipeline/introduction),
[datasets](/documentation/datasets/introduction),
[evaluations](/documentation/evaluations/introduction),
and execution [logs](/documentation/logs/introduction).
Access [API keys](/api-reference/introduction#authentication)
and environment variables are configured at the project level as well.
Think about it as a scope of a certain work. 

A Laminar workspace is a collection of projects accessible and users that have access to them.

On a Pro tier, you can create more workspaces and add people to them. This enables collaboration
including real-time editing of the pipelines.
To do that, you only need to know the email address with which they have registered to Laminar.

1. Navigate to the projects page by clicking the Laminar's logo in the top left corner.
1. Navigate to the workspace by clicking on the workspace name on the left.
1. Click "Add user".
1. Type in their email and click "Add".

In the same page, you can create projects.

### Pipelines

Once you create your first project, you will be redirected to the pipelines page. Pipeline builder is the place
where you build your core logic, evaluations logic, and experiment with the flows. For more information on pipelines
and navigating in the builder page, see the [pipelines documentation](/documentation/pipeline/introduction).

Think of every pipeline that you build as a large function with input parameters and one or many outputs.
Laminar allows you to deploy every pipeline and then call it as an API endpoint externally from your code.

Every input node of the pipeline will serve as an input parameter in the API call and the outputs will
be returned in the response. See [API reference](/api-reference/pipelines/pipeline_run) for more.

### Evaluations and datasets

Laminar has a powerful set of tools for evaluations where you can create any custom pipeline to evaluate
how your other pipelines work or evaluate the data in your datasets. In order to run evaluations, you need to
create a [dataset](/documentation/datasets/introduction), add data to it, and create an evaluator pipeline. See more in
[evaluation documentation](/documentation/evaluations/introduction).

Evaluations run in parallel batches, and you can get the results faster than you ever had seen it before.

## Onboarding to Laminar

Read onto the following sections to learn how to [migrate your previous workflows](/tutorials/first-pipeline) to Laminar or start from scratch.
