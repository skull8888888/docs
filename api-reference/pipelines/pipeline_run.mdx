### Description

Any pipeline can be called and accessed externally through an API.
First, you need to set the target version of the pipeline, and then the target pipeline version will be exposed as an endpoint.

You can send request with various inputs. Inputs can be of type string, or ChatMessage.

The response is an object. It contains `runId` and `outputs`. `outputs` is an object which has output node names as keys.
Each value is an object, with a key `value`, and the value is the actual value.
