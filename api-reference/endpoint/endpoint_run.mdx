### Description

Any pipeline can be deployed to an [Endpoint](/documentation/endpoints/introduction), so that it can be accessed externally through an API.
This endpoint is used to call a deployed Endpoint.

You can send request with various inputs. Inputs can be of type string, or ChatMessage.

The response is an object. It contains `runId` and `outputs` object, which, in turn, has output node names as keys.
Each value is an object, with a key `value`, and the value is the actual value.
