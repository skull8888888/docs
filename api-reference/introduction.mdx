## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Project API key as Bearer token.

To get the token, go to "api keys" page and move to Project API keys section. Then get a token from there or generate a new one.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
