Each endpoint's page in OpenAPI specification specifies the method, path and parameters to be used. Additionally, you can try sending the request from there.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Project API key as Bearer token.

To get the token, go to "settings" page and move to "Project API keys" section. Then get a token from there or generate a new one.

Note that each project has different Project API keys. For switching between projects, press "Laminar" icon at the top-left of the dashboard.
