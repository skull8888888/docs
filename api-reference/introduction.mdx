## General

Use the following base URL: `https://api.lmnr.ai/v1`

For example, `POST https://api.lmnr.ai/v1/endpoint/run`

Each endpoint's page specifies the method, path and parameters to be used. Additionally, you can try sending the request from there.

For more detailed information about each endpoint or schema, check our OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Project API key as Bearer token.

To get the token, go to "settings" page and move to "Project API keys" section. Then get a token from there or generate a new one.

Note that each project has different Project API keys. For switching between projects, press "Laminar" icon at the top-left of the dashboard.
