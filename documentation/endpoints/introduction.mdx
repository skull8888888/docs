## Concept

Endpoints are proxies to your pipelines externally accessible via API.

Use our [Python SDK](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr-python) or [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr-ts) for calling endpoints.

Endpoints belong to projects and are uniquely identified and accessible by their name.
Every endpoint has exactly one pipeline version, which is invoked when endpoint is called.

Note that only committed pipeline versions can be deployed to an endpoint.
That's required because endpoint can point only to immutable pipeline versions, i.e. commits.

If you want to call endpoint by sending HTTP request, read detailed instructions on how to call endpoint in [OpenAPI specification](/api-reference/endpoint/endpoint_run).

## Creating endpoint

Endpoints can be created by going to Endpoints page and clicking "New endpoint".

After you enter endpoint name, click "Create" and it will be created.

## Name restriction

Because the endpoints must be accessible externally via the laminar API, **endpoint names must be unique within the project**. Also they cannot be changed later.

## Deploy pipeline to an Endpoint

1. Create the endpoint, if it's not already created.
1. Go to pipeline and select the pipeline version to be deployed.
1. Click "Deploy" from the pipeline builder, then select the endpoint.
1. If the current pipeline version is "Workshop" version, then enter a name for the new commit, which will be created.
1. Click "Deploy" and the pipeline version will be deployed to endpoint. From this point on, whenever endpoint is called, it will invoke the latest pipeline version.

You can always check which pipeline version is currently deployed on the Endpoint's page.

## Endpoint history

History of the deployed pipeline versions can be seen on the Endpoints page.

## Call endpoint

Endpoints can be called by using our [Python SDK](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr-python) and [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr-ts).

If you want to call endpoint by sending HTTP request, read detailed instructions on how to call endpoint in [OpenAPI specification](/api-reference/endpoint/endpoint_run).

For the quickstart, the sample call for the endpoint will be shown on the endpoint's page, if you click "use API".

Don't forget to pass `"env"` with every request to the endpoint, which contains environment variables required for the pipeline.
The environment variables from [env variables](/documentation/pipeline/env-variables) page won't be applied, since they are only stored in your browser.
Note that streaming through server-sent events can be enabled, if `"stream"` is set to `true`.
