### Regular event

Regular events are essentially semantic events but with the value is not provided by the LLM, and instead is directly provided at the moment of the event trigger.

Register an event in the Laminar UI and trigger it from the code using the `lmnr_context.event` function.

```python
from laminar import lmnr_context

# rest of the code

lmnr_context.event("Sentiment", "POSITIVE")
```
