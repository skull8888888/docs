## How it works

Endpoint execution logs can be exported to datasets. Outputs of each nodes are stored as values, and node names are keys.
This can be done manually, where you can select only the nodes you want to include. [Read more](/documentation/datasets/adding-data#2-endpoint-logs).
Alternatively, you can set this up for automatic writing - every execution result will be written asynchronously in the background both to logs and to datasets.

## Setting up

To set automatic export to dataset, follow these steps:

1. Go to the logs page for your project.
1. Select the endpoint.
1. Click "Configure writing to dataset..."
1. Select/de-select datasets you want your logs to be automatically promoted to.
1. Click Save.
