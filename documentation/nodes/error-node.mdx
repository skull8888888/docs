## Error node

Error node is useful if you want to explicitly throw an error.
For example, this can come in handy in the cases when [format validator node](/documentation/nodes/format-validator)
could not validate the format.

Error node takes in exactly one input and throws an error with the same value.
It supports all the [input types](/documentation/nodes/input-output#input-types) in order to be able to throw errors anywhere in the pipeline.
