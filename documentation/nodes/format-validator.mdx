description: Validate string format with a regex

## Description

Format Validator node can redirect the flow of the pipeline based on whether its input matches its regex. It has [conditional output handles](/documentation/pipeline/working-with-nodes#conditional-output-handles); that is, it will redirect the flow to only one of its outputs.

## Examples

|Regex           | Input            | output
|----------------|------------------|----------
| `\w+!`         |`"Hello!"`        | correct
| `Hel+o, \w+!`  |`"Hello, world!"` | correct
| `\d+`          |`"Hello!"`        | incorrect
