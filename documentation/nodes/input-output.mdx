## Input and Output nodes

Input and Output nodes are special. They "define" the API once you deploy the pipeline. That is, your request
to a [Laminar pipeline](/api-reference/pipeline/pipeline_run) API must send all inputs in a map following
the pattern `"inputNodeName": "inputValue"`. Similarly, the response message contains a map from each output
node's name to the output result of that node. Read more in [api reference](/api-reference/pipeline/pipeline_run).

In addition, whenever you drag and drop a new input node, an input field will appear in the sidebar on the left.
You must fill this field in order to run the pipeline.

For your convenience, upon new connection, an unconnected input node changes its name to match the handle it is being connected to.

### Input types

An input node has a type, which defines the type of output it produces and the type for its output handle as well.
For example, `String` input node produces a `String` output and can be connected only to input handles expecting `String`
value, e.g. Semantic Search's `query` handle.

For your convenience, upon new connection, an unconnected input node changes its type and name to follow the type and name
of a handle it is being connected to.
