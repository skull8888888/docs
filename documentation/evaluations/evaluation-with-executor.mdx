## Key concepts

- Executor pipeline – the pipeline being evaluated
- Evaluator pipeline - the pipeline evaluating the results
- Dataset format – two fixed JSON objects: `target` and `data` each with any keys.
  - `target` – data sent to the evaluator pipeline
  - `data` – data sent to the executor pipeline

<Tip> **What happens if executor pipeline has an output node named same as one of the keys in target?**
Executor outputs have a higher priority over and overwrite the values in `target`. </Tip>

## Detailed flow

For every datapoint in the dataset, evaluation does the following:

1. Set all the values in `data` of the datapoint as values to the input nodes of the _executor_ pipeline.
This is done by matching* the keys in the `data` object to the input node names of the _executor_ pipeline.
1. Run the evaluation pipeline. All required [env variables](/documentation/pipeline/env-variables) must be set for this to succeed.
1. All outputs of the _executor_ pipeline are extracted and set as inputs to the _evaluator_ pipeline.
This is done by matching the output node names of the _executor_ pipeline to the input node names of the _evaluator_ pipeline.
1. Set all the values in `target` of the datapoint as values to the input nodes of the _evaluator_ pipeline.
This is done by matching* the keys in the `target` object to the input node names of the _evaluator_ pipeline.
1. Evaluator pipeline is run. All required [env variables](/documentation/pipeline/env-variables) must be set for this to succeed.
1. Evaluator pipeline produces a single numeric output. This is stored in the results of the evaluation.

## Requirements

- Executor pipeline has at least one commit.
- `data` at least contains keys matching* the names of the input nodes on the executor pipeline.
- All required environment variables for the executor run are set in the [Env vars page](/documentation/pipeline/env-variables#full-set-up).
- Evaluator pipeline has at least one commit.
- Names of the output nodes of the executor pipeline match* the names of the corresponding input nodes of the evaluator pipeline.
- If you want to use some target data from the dataset, `target` must at least contain keys matching* the names of the input 
nodes on the evaluator pipeline.
- All required environment variables for the evaluator run are set in the [Env vars page](/documentation/pipeline/env-variables#full-set-up).
- Evaluator pipeline must produce one output. This output must be parsable into a number (8-bit float).
