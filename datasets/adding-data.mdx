You can add datapoints from 2 sources.

### 1. File upload
Supported file formats are: `.csv`, `.json`, `.jsonl`.
- csv - **header is required**, default separator and minimal quoting are assumed. If a row has an empty value or less values than headers, missing values will be filled with empty strings.
- json - the file must contain **one array** of objects, each with primitive (string, number, boolean, null) values
- jsonlines - each line must contain an object, each with primitive (string, number, boolean, null) values

If there is an error parsing the file, no datapoints will be added.
If a single value in the file does not conform to format, it will be silently ignored.

### 2. Endpoint logs
After you deploy the pipeline to Endpoint, each API call to deployed pipeline is logged to Logs.
After that, you can upload the datapoints from logs by selecting the Endpoint, its Pipeline Version, and its node, from which the logs will be uploaded.
Note that can simply select "All" and not select any particular node, if you want to upload the logs based on whole pipeline's Input and Output nodes.
