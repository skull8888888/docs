## Concept

Dataset is a collection of datapoints. It can be used for the following purposes:
1. Datasource for semantic cache/search.
2. Provide inputs and expected outputs for [Evaluations](/evaluations/introduction).

Dataset can be created by going to Datasets page and pressing "New dataset".

In this page, you can learn how to use datasets for semantic cache/search, how to use for evaluations, and how to add datapoints.

## Use case: Semantic Search

Datasets can be used as a datasource for semantic search. Semantic search is used in the following places:
1. ~~[LLM node](/nodes/LLM)'s semantic cache~~
2. [Semantic Search node](/nodes/semantic-search)'s datasource.

For that, you'll need to index the dataset.

### Indexing

Usually, for semantic search, we need to embed the word.
To do that, you should specify the column based on which the embedding is created.
To put simply, we need to know the column based on which the semantic similarity search is done.

To do that, press "Index/Re-index", select the column name, and press "Index".

</Frame>

If you don't index the dataset, the semantic search won't be able to find the data from the dataset.

## Use case: Evaluations

Datasets can be used for [Evaluations](/evaluations/introduction) to specify expected inputs and outputs.

For that, you'll need to name the Input and Output nodes in the pipeline to be evaluated same to the columns in the dataset.
Input node must have the same name with the input data's column name, and Output node must have the same name with expected output's column name. ([Read more](/evaluations/introduction#concept))
