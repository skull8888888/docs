title: Label spans
---

## Introduction

One good way to filter correct data for a dataset is labelling spans from both
traces and evaluation traces. This is useful when you want to filter out only
the relevant data from the traces.

## Span label types

Supported span label types are `Boolean` and `Categorical`.

### Boolean

Boolean span can take a `true` or `false` value. This is useful if you want to
tag spans with a binary label.

### Categorical

Categorical labels can take one of the predefined values. One way to think about
this is to consider the categorical label as a tag. For example, you can tag
spans with `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral` sentiment.

## Label spans

To label a span, first, open a trace and click on the span you want to label.

Then, click on the "Add Label" button in the top right corner. Here you can choose
one of the existing labels or create a new one.
