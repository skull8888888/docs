## Introduction

Datasets can be used as data collections. One way to add data to a dataset is by
exporting spans from both traces and evaluation tracest.

To help you filter traces and export only relevant ones to datasets, you can add
labels to spans. Laminar provides you with a UI for that. This page explains label
types.

## Label classes

Every label on a span has a class. The class defines the type of the label,
the possible values, and the name of the label. For example `sentiment` can be
a class of a categorical label with possible values `positive`, `negative`, and
`neutral`.

Every user can assign one label value per label class per span.

## Span label types

Supported span label types are `Boolean` and `Categorical`.

### Boolean

Boolean span can take a `true` or `false` value. This is useful if you want to
tag spans with a binary label.

### Categorical

Categorical labels can take one of the predefined values. One way to think about
this is to consider the categorical label as a tag. For example, you can tag
spans with `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral` sentiment.

## Label spans

To label a span, first, open a trace and click on the span you want to label.

Then, click on the "Add Label" button in the top right corner. Here you can choose
one of the existing labels or create a new one.
