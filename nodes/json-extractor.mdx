## JSON Extractor node

This node is similar to [String template node](/nodes/string-template), except that it parses
JSON from a single input and can extract just the relevant part. You can also template it, to add
more to the node's output.

For example, let's say the input to the node is the following JSON:

```json
{
    "forecast": {
        "location": "Hill Valley, CA",
        "summary": "Warm and sunny",
        "details": {
            "temperature": 23,
            "temperatureUnit": "C",
            "clouds": 3,
            "cloudsUnit": "%"
        }
    },
    "dateReadable": "October 21, 2015"
}
```

You can extract it with this template:

```
On {{dateReadable}}, in {{forecast.location}}, it is going to be {{forecast.summary}}.
```

This will render into:

```
On October 21, 2015, in Hill Valley, CA, it is going to be warm and sunny.
```

However, if you wanted to extract the entire forecast, the template `{{forecast}}` would render `[Object]`. This is because the
node is a subset of [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html), which render things in JS style.

In order to avoid this, prefix your JSON key name with the word `json ` followed by a whitespace.

Therefore, the correct template would be:

```json
{{json forecast}}
```
