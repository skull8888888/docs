title: Switch

## Switch node

Switch node sends the input value to one of the output routes, based on the condition input.
It has [conditional output handles](/pipeline/working-with-nodes#conditional-output-handles); that is, it will redirect the flow to only one of its outputs.

Switch node requires an exact case-sensitive match between the **route name** and the condition value.

Unlike [semantic switch](/nodes/semantic-switch), it is NOT the `input` that is matched against the route, it is the `condition`.
If you still want the input to be both matched and also conditionally sent through to one of the outputs, you can connect both handles to the same node.

## No match; default route

If switch node does not find a match in any of the routes defined, by default it will throw an error.

However, for more customizable error handling, you can enable a default route that will be matched last, if no other matches are found.
The name of the default route does not matter, it is there for your convenience.
