## Code node

Code node allows you to execute any quick custom logic in a python environment. Open the code node and enter the code you want to run.

Code node executes the `main` function from the code written in it.

The inputs to this node and output are determined based on the function signature.

For example, let's consider signature: `def main(string_list: list[str], chat_messages: list[ChatMessage]) -> str:`

This signature will be parsed, and it will result in 2 inputs: string_list (`StringList`) and chat_messages (`ChatMessageList`). As a result, you'll be able to connect 2 nodes, which have output types `StringList` and `ChatMessageList`, respectively.

Also, it will result in the fact that output type of this node will be `String`. So you'll be able to connect its output to any node, which expects input `String` or `Any`.

Supported types for both inputs and outputs:
- str
- list[str]
- list[ChatMessage]
- float (use float for int as well)

<Info>
Whenever the signature is not parsing fails, check the following:

1. The function name must be "main".
2. Annotate type of input arguments.
3. Annotate return type of the function.

If one of the conditions is not met, the input/output handles won't appear.
</Info>

Below is the definition of ChatMessage.

```
class ChatMessage:
    role: str
    content: str
```

Output type will be validated at runtime, and this node will fail if the returned output's type doesn't match the expected type.

Python version: 3.12.3

You can add other functions, if you need, and call them inside "main" function.
Do not remove `main` function, as it is the entry point for the node execution.

Standard libraries are available. The "requests" library can also be used.
External packages will be supported soon. Contact us to join the waitlist!

### Available libraries

All standard libraries are available. For example, `math`, `random`, `json`, etc.
You can import them as `import math` and use them.

In addition, [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) module is available for convenience of making API calls.
