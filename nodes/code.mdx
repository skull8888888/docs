## Code node

Code node allows you to execute any quick custom logic in a python environment.

The handles of the node are input arguments to the first function you define.
The function must return a string or chat message list.

All standard libraries are available.
In addition, [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) module is available for convenience of making API calls.
