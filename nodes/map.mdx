## Map node

Map node can take a list of strings and call subpipeline with each of the strings.
Then it will return a list of output strings with results of all subpipelines.

Map node's subpipeline can only be a pipeline which has only one input node of type String and one output node.

To setup the map node, you only need to select pipeline and pipeline version of the subpipeline to map inputs to.

### Things to consider
1. Only commit pipeline versions can be used as subpipelines.
1. For now, subpipeline can only be a pipeline which has only one input node of type String and one output node. Input and Output nodes of the subpipeline can have any name.
1. Each subpipeline run will be counted as a separate run towards a total number of runs, so when you run a pipeline which has a Map node, the total run count will be incremented by (1 + length of inputs to map node).
