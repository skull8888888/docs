## Router node

Router node sends the input value to one of the output routes, based on the condition input. It has [conditional output handles](/pipeline/working-with-nodes#conditional-output-handles); that is, it will redirect the flow to only one of its outputs.

Unlike [semantic router](/nodes/semantic-router), it is NOT the input that is matched against the route, it is the condition.
If you still want the input to be both matched and also conditionally sent through to one of the outputs, you can connect both handles to the same output.

Router node requires an exact case-sensitive match between the **route name** and the condition value.

## No match; default route

If router node does not find a match in any of the routes defined, by default it will throw an error.

However, for more customisable error handling, you can enable a default route that will be matched last, if no other matches are found. The name of the default route does not matter, it is there for your convenience.
