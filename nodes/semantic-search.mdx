## Semantic Search node

Semantic search allows you to search over uploaded files or over the datasets you create.

## Configuration

### Threshold

`Threshold` represents minimal semantic similarity between the query and the search result for it to be selected. Valid range: `0.0` - `1.0`. For example, if the threshold is set at `0.42`, only the contexts with similarity above or equal to `0.42` to the search query will be selected

### Limit

`Limit` is the maximum number of contexts with similarity over threshold to be returned. Valid range: non-negative integers.

### Template

You can control the output through a template where keys are placed into `{{moustache syntax}}`.
This template is applied to every content retrieved by semantic search. 

All retrieved contents, rendered according to template, are joined via a newline character `\n`.

The keys that can de used in a template are different for file datasources and dataset datasources and are described in the next sections.
Also, you can check [examples](/nodes/semantic-search#examples) below.

#### Files' reserved keys

- `relevance_index` - An index, which starts from 1, representing the order in the list of retrieved contents ordered by similarity to the query. 1 means this content is the most semantically similar.
- `content` - The relevant retrieved chunk.
- `page_content` - The content of the whole page, which contains the `content` chunk. 
- `page_number` - The number of the page, which contains the `content` chunk. Only applicable to file formats which are divided into pages, e.g. PDF. 0 for files with no pages.

#### Datasets' keys

- `relevance_index` - An index, which starts from 1, representing the order in the list of retrieved contents ordered by similarity to the query. 1 means this content is the most semantically similar.
- Additionally, you can select any column name from your dataset as a key.

## Output

The output of a semantic search node is a single string of all rendered (with each key replaced by its value) templates joined via a newline character `\n`.

## Examples

### Example template for searching over files

### Template

```
[{{relevance_index}}]

{{content}}

---

```

#### Rendered output

```
[1]

This portion of the file is the most relevant

---

[2]

This portion of the file is a little bit less relevant

---

```

### Example template for searching over datasets.

This will search over a dataset that has keys `short_description` and `price` for a list of products.

#### Template

```
{{relevance_index}}. {{short_description}}
Price: {{price}}

```

#### Output

```
1. This is the best frying pan you can find in household shops.
Price: $25.99

2. The frying pan everyone must get!
Price: $14.49

```
