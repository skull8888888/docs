## Semantic Search node

Semantic search allows you to search over uploaded files or over the datasets you create.

## Configuration

### Threshold

`Threshold` represents minimal semantic similarity between the query and the search result for it to be selected. Valid range: `0.0` - `1.0`.
For example, if the threshold is set at `0.42`, only the contents with similarity above or equal to `0.42` to the search query will be selected

### Limit

`Limit` is the maximum number of contents with similarity over threshold to be returned. Valid range: non-negative integers.

### Template

You can control the output through a template where keys are placed into `{{moustache syntax}}`.
This template is applied to every content retrieved by semantic search. 

All retrieved contents, rendered according to template, are joined via a newline character `\n`.

The keys that can de used in a template are different for file datasources and dataset datasources and are described in the next sections.
Also, you can check [examples](/nodes/semantic-search#examples) below.

#### Files' reserved keys

- `relevance_index` - An index, which starts from 1, representing the order in the list of retrieved contents ordered by similarity to the query. 1 means this content is the most semantically similar.
- `content` - The relevant retrieved chunk.
- `page_content` - The content of the whole page, which contains the `content` chunk. 
- `page_number` - The number of the page, which contains the `content` chunk. Only applicable to file formats which are divided into pages, e.g. PDF. 0 for files with no pages.

#### Datasets' keys

- `relevance_index` - An index, which starts from 1, representing the order in the list of retrieved contents ordered by similarity to the query. 1 means this content is the most semantically similar.
- Additionally, you can select any column name from your dataset as a key.

### Datasources

You can click "Add datasource" button and add as many datasources as you want. It means the semantic search will search for the most semantically similar texts among all datasources.

One type of datasources that can be added is a file.
<SemanticSearchFileUploadSnippet />

Another type of datasources that can be added is a dataset. You can go to "datasets" page, create a dataset, add datapoints, index them, and then use it here [(Read more)](/datasets/introduction###indexing).
If datapoints are not indexed, then there will be no entries in our vector database to search through.

## Output

The output of a semantic search node is a single string of all rendered (with each key replaced by its value) templates joined via a newline character `\n`.

## Examples

### Example template for searching over files

### Template

```
[{{relevance_index}}]

{{content}}

---

```

#### Rendered output

```
[1]

This portion of the file is the most relevant

---

[2]

This portion of the file is a little bit less relevant

---

```

### Example template for searching over datasets.

This will search over a dataset that has keys `short_description` and `price` for a list of products.

#### Template

```
{{relevance_index}}. {{short_description}}
Price: {{price}}

```

#### Output

```
1. This is the best frying pan you can find in household shops.
Price: $25.99

2. The frying pan everyone must get!
Price: $14.49

```
