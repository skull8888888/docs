## Subpipeline node

Subpipeline node can call another pipeline (subpipeline).

First, select pipeline and pipeline version of the pipeline to be used.
After selection, this node's inputs will be set according to the Input node's of the selected pipeline version.
Then you can connect the handles.

### Things to consider
1. Only commit pipeline versions can be used as subpipelines.
1. For now, only pipeline versions with a single Output node can be used as subpipelines. If you have pipeline with multiple outputs, then only one of those outputs will be used as Subpipeline node's output.
1. Subpipeline run will be counted as a separate run towards a total number of runs.
