## String Template node

String template node allows you to create a templated string and dynamically fill it in at execution time.

For example, if you create the following template:

```
Hello, dear {{name}}
```

A handle will appear on the left called `name`. Then, if you connect a node that passes the value `Alice` to that handle,
the node will replace the template with the word, rendering the following:

```
Hello, dear Alice
```

### Features and restrictions:

- You can add as many variables to the template.
- You can repeat every variable multiple times
- Variable names may contain alphanumeric (basic ASCII latin) characters, underscores `_`, dashes `-`, and dollar signs `$`.
