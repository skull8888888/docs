## Function call

Very similarly to [Tool calling](/nodes/tool-call), you can call your own functions whenever needed.
The difference for this node is that it does not have to be an LLM tool call it can be called anywhere in the flow.

Start off by defining the function signature in the node. Node's name must match the function name,
and the parameters specified must match the function signature. The function must return a string or a list of chat messages.
If the function returns a more complex structure, such as a JSON dictionary, please stringify it.

Every parameter in the signature will add an input handle to the function call node.

There are 2 ways to use functions nodes. Using Laminar's remote debugger, or calling the endpoint through our SDK.

### Laminar remote debugger.

If you want to test a flow that includes a function call, you can use Laminar remote debugger in
[NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lmnr-ai/lmnr) or in [Python](https://pypi.org/project/lmnr/).

The overall flow must be the following:

1. Create a pipeline that includes function call nodes.
    1. Don't forget to name function nodes after your local functions that you would like to call and define their signatures.
1. Run the LaminarRemoteDebugger in your NodeJS or Python code with references to your local functions.
This will return and print your unique session ID.
    1. Find specific instructions on how to do that in the SDK docs (README in each package)
1. Copy the session ID and paste it as an environment variable `DEBUGGER_SESSION_ID` in lmnr.ai workshop in your browser.
1. Run the pipeline from your browser

### Calling endpoints through SDK

SDK in [NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lmnr-ai/lmnr) or in [Python](https://pypi.org/project/lmnr/) also supports
running Laminar endpoints. You can deploy your pipeline with a tool call node just like any other pipeline; however,
when calling the pipeline from your code, make sure to specify the optional parameter `tools`, which is a list of local functions.

Example code snippets:

Python:
```python
from lmnr import Laminar, NodeInput

def my_function(arg1: str, arg2: str) -> NodeInput:
    return f'{arg1}{arg2}'

l = Laminar('<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>')
result = l.run(
    endpoint='my_endpoint_name',
    inputs={'input_node_name': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'hello'}]},
    tools=[my_function]
)
```

JS:

```javascript
import { Laminar, NodeInput } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

const myFunction = ({arg1, arg2}: {arg1: string, arg2: number}): NodeInput => {
  // this tool teaches LLMs the beauty of JavaScript!
  return arg1 + arg2;
}

const l = new Laminar('<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>');
const result = await l.run({
    endpoint: 'my_endpoint_name',
    inputs: {'input_node_name': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'hello'}]},
    tools: [myFunction],
});
```
