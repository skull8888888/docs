## Error node

Error node is useful if you want to explicitly through an error. For example, this can come in handy in the cases when [format validator node](/nodes/format-validator) could not validate the format.

Error node takes in exactly one input and throws an error with the same value. It supports all the [input types](/nodes/input-output#input-types) in order to be able to throw error anywhere in the pipeline.
