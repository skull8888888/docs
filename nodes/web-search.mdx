## Web Search node

Web Search node allows you to search the web. It searches the web, scrapes top results, renders them according to user-specified template, and merges them.

Scraping some pages may fail and it will be silently ignored. However, if scraping failed for all pages, then this node will return an error.

If you plan to pass the output of this node to LLM, then we suggest to use models such as Claude, which have larger context window size.

## Configuration

### Limit

The number of top results returned by the search to be scraped.
We suggest to put at least 2-3, since sometimes the top result may be irrelevant or it may not contain any useful content.

### Template

You can control the output through a template where keys are placed into `{{moustache syntax}}`.
This template is applied to every content retrieved by semantic search. 

All retrieved contents, rendered according to template, are joined via a newline character `\n`.

The keys which can be used in the template:
- `title` - The title of the scraped web page.
- `url` - The url of the scraped web page.
- `content` - The whole content of the scraped page. Note that we remove the html boilerplate and try to convert to markdown.
