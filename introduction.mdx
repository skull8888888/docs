## Laminar

Infrastructure-first approach to building LLM pipelines.

We provide a single platform to build, deploy, monitor, and evaluate LLM apps.
Laminar offers an extensible set of tools to help you make reliable and cost-effective LLM apps,
and bring them to production in seconds by deploying to our fast and scalable Rust infra.

## First steps

To begin with, you can [check our demo](https://www.loom.com/share/0dabced01c77478ab206766f10ab23c7) to get an overview of features available on Laminar.

After that, you can start with reading about how to [create a pipeline](/pipeline/introduction).
Try creating a simple pipeline by connecting Input node to [LLM node](/nodes/LLM), and then connecting LLM node to Output node.

Step by step, you'll unveil various functionalities of our platform and make your LLM app ready for production.

## Key features

- **Versatile pipeline builder**: Build LLM pipeline using variety of nodes with required functionality provided out of the box
- **Endpoints and checks**: Deploy your pipeline to an API endpoint in seconds, while protecting it with custom checks
- **Logging**: Conveniently access the logs and see how users interact with your pipeline through endpoint
- **Evaluations**: Evaluate your LLM pipeline with a broad set of metrics
- **Semantic Search**: Cache data or upload it so that it can be quickly accessed based on semantic similarity
- **Semantic router**: Direct the flow of pipeline by utilizing our semantic router
