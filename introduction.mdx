## Laminar

Infrastructure-first approach to building LLM pipelines.

We provide a single platform to build, deploy, monitor, and evaluate LLM apps.
Laminar offers an extensible set of tools to help you make reliable and cost-effective LLM apps,
and bring them to production in seconds by deploying to our fast and scalable Rust infra.

## First steps

To begin with, you can [check our demo](https://www.loom.com/share/0dabced01c77478ab206766f10ab23c7) to get an overview of features available on Laminar.

After that, you can start with reading about how to [create a pipeline](/pipeline/introduction).

Step by step, you'll unveil various functionalities of our platform and make your LLM app ready for production.
