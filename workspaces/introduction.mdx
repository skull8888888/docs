## Concept

Workspace is a collection of [projects](/projects/introduction) and users that have access to them. Currently, all workspace users have the same privilege to perform any actions inside the workspace.

## Creating a new workspace

When you create an account, you are created your personal workspace by default.

To create a new workspace,

1. Navigate to the projects page by clicking the Laminar's logo in the top left corner, once in any (non-landing) page.
1. Click "New workspace".
1. Give the new workspace a name and click "Create".

## Adding a new user to the workspace

You can add new users both to your personal default workspace and to any workspace you've created. You only need to know the email address with which they have registered to Laminar.

1. Navigate to the projects page by clicking the Laminar's logo in the top left corner, once in any (non-landing) page.
1. Navigate to the workspace by clicking on the workspace name on the left.
1. Click "Add user".
1. Type in their email and click "Add".
